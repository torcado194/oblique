**create oblique projections of any shape**. useful for creating shadows, 3d depth, visual perspective, and more!


oblique calculates tangent points itself, ensuring correct projections from any possible input shape.


this plugin was inspired by the Adobe Illustrator plugin [opo by 63mutants](http://63mutants.com/subc/products/opo_m01/opo_m01.php).


also check out [Roto](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/733184376355671573), a similar figma plugin having a couple key differences. oblique calculates faces itself instead of relying on a 3d engine, making it faster and produce less complex results, at the cost of some features such as perspective and lighting options.
